# Rammerhead Browser (Unofficial Source)
The unofficial source of the Rammerhead Browser by binary-person.

# Disclaimer
This is not meant to be an exact 1:1 source copy. This is only to be enough components and code to implement the UI from the bundle. The bundle found in the [.reference](./.reference/main.js) folder is the main source for some components. Lastly, yes, some of this code has been generated by AI using Copilot. Some parts I've hand decompiled and some were assisted. If you have any issues at all with this, do NOT be suprised, this was a project of pure boredom.   

# Demo
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
